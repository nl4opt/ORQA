Option (B) only mentions the cost of raw materials and option (C) only mentions the cost of the quadratic interactions between each pair. The span \"meet the industry standards and customer expectations by achieving the target MON of 90\" describes a fixed MON target of 90, hence option (A) i.e., maximizing MON value is incorrect. The span \"The selling price of the mixed gasoline is fixed at 140\" in the question tells us the fixed selling price of gasoline.

{"QUESTION_TYPE": "Q4", "CONTEXT": "You are an operations manager in the agricultural sector. Your task is to streamline the process of getting crops from farms, processing or storing them as needed, and finally distributing them to various markets or direct consumers. Your farms produce diverse crops, from grains and vegetables to fruits and more. Each type of produce has its own cost of cultivation, influenced by factors like seeds, fertilizers, labor, and machinery. Additionally, different farms might have varying prices and yields for the same crops, given their location, soil quality, and techniques. Storage and processing is one important consideration since opening each processing or storage center has a fixed cost. Transportation is another important concern because different produce requires different conditions for transit. Strawberries might need refrigeration to stay fresh, while grains might not. You could look at refrigerated trucks, traditional cargo vehicles, or rail, each with its associated cost and suitability. The transportation choice can affect the produce's freshness, quality, and subsequent market value. Capacities are also crucial to consider. Each farm can produce only up to its potential, which is dictated by the land size, weather conditions, and the farming techniques. Conversely, each market or direct consumer has specific demands based on consumption patterns and preferences. Overproduction can lead to wastage, while underproduction can mean missed opportunities and unsatisfied demands.\nFurthermore, each market or buyer has preferences. Some might prioritize organic produce; others might have a higher demand for a particular fruit due to seasonal festivals or trends. Catering to these varied demands without compromising on quality becomes vital. You aim to minimize expenses from cultivation to transportation.
